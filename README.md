### Active Learning for Lexical Annotation

Alok Ulhas Parlikar, Andrew Jake Rosenbaum, Jeffrey Paul Lilly, Jeffrey Penrod Adams 

Abstract: Features are disclosed for active learning to identify the words which are likely to improve the guessing and automatic speech recognition (ASR) after manual annotation. When a speech recognition system needs pronunciations for words, a lexicon is typically used. For unknown words, pronunciation-guessing (G2P) may be included to provide pronunciations in an unattended (e.g., automatic) fashion. However, having manually (e.g., by a human) annotated pronunciations provides better ASR than having automatic pronunciations that may, in some instances, be wrong. The included active learning features help to direct these limited annotation resources.
